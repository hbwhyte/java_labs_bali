1) What is a Java package?
    A group of related classes, interfaces, enumerations (?), and annotations (?).

2) What is the CLASSPATH variable all about?
    It is a way to tell applications, including the JDK tools, where to look for user classes

3) What does the package structure mirror?
    File directories

4 How do packages affect access to Java classes?
    The "protected class" allows only access only to classes within that same package.

5) What is an interface?
    An interface is a contract between developers. It contains abstract methods that must be called if someone
    implements that interface.

6) What makes interfaces unique?
    Interfaces define one or more method that have no body. (?)

7) What keyword is used to specify that a class is going to use a separate interface?
    implements

8) What makes interfaces so useful?
    Especially when working with multiple developers, interfaces are important tools to ensure required methods are
    created. If an interface is implemented without one (or more) of the required methods, an error will be thrown
    until all methods of the interface are implemented.

9) What was added in JDK 8 that makes interfaces even more useful?
    In Java 8, they added method definitions for interfaces - static or default. You can now add definitions using static
    or default without breaking the existing classes.

10) How many interfaces can a single class implement?
    No specific limit - it can be more than one.

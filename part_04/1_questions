Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
    An array is an indexable, linear collection of variables of the same type, referred to by the same name.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
   String[] cats = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
    An array of arrays. e.g. arrMulti [] []
    This means each index of the array contains an array.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
    int[][] scores = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
    String itemTen = dogs[9];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
    If you try and access an item in an array for an index that doesn't exist. E.g. if you have an array named
    arrayExample of length 5 and you try to get arrayExample[7].

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
    int retrieved = array[array.length - 2];

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
    2,147,483,642 or Integer.MAX_VALUE - 5

9) What is a bubble sort?
    It is a simple sorting algorithm used for organizing small arrays.

10) How does a bubble sort work?
    It uses a nested for loop. The inner loop (b) checks the previous element to see if they are in the right order.
    If they are out of order, they swap positions. The outer loop keeps the program working through the whole array.

    for (a = 1; a < size; a++)
     for(b = size-1; b >= a; b--) {
       if(nums[b-1] > nums[b]) { // if out of order
         // exchange elements
         t = nums[b-1];
         nums[b-1] = nums[b];
         nums[b] = t;
    } }

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
    If you have a large multidimensional array that is sparsely populated, it can be beneficial. For example if you
    are looking at online shoppers by day, and certain days like Black Friday need extremely long arrays, while other
    days need significantly shorter ones.

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

    int[] array = new int[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < int.length-1; i++) {
        System.out.println(array[i]);
        }

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.

    int i = 0
    int[] array = new int[10];
    while (i < int.length-1) {
        System.out.println(array[i]);
        i++;
        }

14) What is a queue?
    A queue is a data structure class that serves as a data engine to both store and access information. It works
    on a first in, first out (FIFO) property, like a line at the bank.

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
    put = adding something
    get = retrieve something

16) What is a stack?
    A stack is also a data structure class that serves as a data engine to both store and access information.

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
    Queues work on a FIFO property, but stacks work on a FILO (first in, last out) property, like a stack of plates.

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
    When you want to iterate over elements of a collection, such as an array, stack, or queue.

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
    It is a set of classes that implement different data structures such as lists, vectors, sets, and maps. In addition
    to interfaces like lists and queues, it contains classes such as ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue,
    HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
    Using a nested loop, such as a for loop:
        // Outer loop iterating the length of the first dimension of the array (less 1)
            //Inner loop iterating through the array within the array

21) What is a String?
    It is a literal (fixed value in human readable form), which is a set of characters enclosed in quotes. They are
    objects of the String class.

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
    .length()
    .charAt()
    .subString()
    .toString()
    .toCharArray()


23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
    You cannot change them after they have been created

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
    javac appName.java // first you need to compile it
    java className param1 param2 // then you can run it
